# Buzzwire Experiment Code 

This repository contains the Unity and Arduino project files developed for the first buzzwire experiment conducted at COBE lab with two conditions : VR and physical. 

# Projects

The projects can be found in the sub-folders listed below. The software requirements for each project and further details are listed in the individual README files.

1. BuzzWireArduinoCode - Arduino code for the arduinos running in the physical condition setup
2. BuzzWireTestArduinoCode - Arduino code for the arduinos running in the pre/post-test setups
3. BuzzwireUnityService - Unity project for the physical condition managing haptic/audio feedback and sending event signals from the arduino along to iMotions
4. BuzzwireVR - Unity project for the VR condition managing visual/haptic/audio feedback and sending event signals from the arduino along to iMotions
5. HardwareDesigns - Files used for 3D printing the Oculus handle, and electronics layout diagrams (made with fritzing)
